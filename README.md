# GANs for Synthetic Image Generation
This repository contains code for generating synthetic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The code is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras and demonstrates the generation of synthetic images resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models that consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, trained simultaneously to produce high-quality synthetic data. In this project, we utilize GANs to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Results

After running the script, the trained GAN will generate synthetic images resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. These images will be displayed during training, providing visual feedback on the progress of the model.
